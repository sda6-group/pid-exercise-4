  Things can be improved in the exercise.<br>
   1- Handling user input so the program catch all the errors can be happend.<br>
   2- There are two json objects for Pokemon Api (Location,locaion-area). Maybe you can mention that in the exercise. I was confused about     that in the beginning(used location-area).<br>
   3- Make the Application run until the user click something.<br>
